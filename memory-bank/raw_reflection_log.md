TaskRef: "Swap Tailwind color tokens for brand equivalents in shadcn components"

Learnings:
- Perl one-liners can efficiently replace multiple Tailwind color tokens across many files.
- Verifying with ripgrep ensures no legacy color utilities remain.

Difficulties:
- Vitest required the `--run` flag to exit in non-interactive environments.

Successes:
- Lint, type-check, and unit tests all passed after refactoring color utilities.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Maintain a reusable script for future large-scale class refactors.
